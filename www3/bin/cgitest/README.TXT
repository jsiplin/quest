hello.c  - Displays "Hello, world" in plain form. Compile hello.c into
           hello.exe, place the .exe to /cgi-bin/ and request 
           /cgi-bin/hello.exe

helloh.c - Displays "Hello, world!" in html form. The instructions are the
           same as for hello.c - just compile helloh.c into helloh.exe, 
	   place the .exe to /cgi-bin/ and request /cgi-bin/helloh.exe

hello.pl - Displays "Hello, World!" in plain form. Requires Perl installed.
           Just place hello.pl to /cgi-bin/ and request /cgi-bin/hello.pl
