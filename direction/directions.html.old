<H1>Directions for the Siplin Multi Day Easter Egg Hunt</H1>

<H2>The QR codes will give you hints</H2>
<p>For each section of the easter egg hunt you will be given a hint. This hint will lead you to an hard to find egg around the house. 
Inside of the egg there will be a final hint, that tells you were your present is located. The first section will be a searching prize; the second will be a walking prize; 
the third will be a hiking prize; and the last three will be biking prizes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your hunts will be separate but prizes will be close in each sectoin and it is designed to be completed over several days. Once all prizes for all sections are picked up 
there will be a grand prize for you both! You must complete the hunt sections in order. And you will only be given access to the next section once the previous is completed.
Also you only have access to this Easter Egg Hunt server when the firewall is taken down</p>



<P> <B>Good Luck!</B>
